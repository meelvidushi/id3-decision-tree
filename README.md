# id3-decision-tree
This repository contains an implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) Decision Tree Algorithm for classification problems using discrete attributes. The implementation is written in Python using only NumPy, math, and collections.Counter, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn.
